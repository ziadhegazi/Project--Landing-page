This is Ziad Hegazi.
I have my work and files uploaded to github: https://github.com/ziadhegazi/Project--Landing-page
Thank you for viewing my work, any constructive comments and feedback would be appreciated.

------------ For the HTML ------------------
I have talen the layout idea from the udacity project file, however, the rest of the design and work are my own.
I have linked any external file such as the css and the javascript files.
tried to add class and id attributes as much as necessary for me to be able to manipulate them later with css and js.



------------For the CSS ------------------
The css file haa been broken up into parts according to which section is being edited e.g: navigation bar sections.
I have choosen this color scheme with this design based on personal prefrence after intensive research and lots of youtube watching.
There has been attempts to use and include animations; many have failed and hopfully in the future ill work more on that. However, sove have succeded and Im proud of my exponential progress.


------------For the JavaScript ------------------
I left the js part as last because it is considered the hardest for me. It required many tuturials and trial-and-error attempts to react the desired goal..
